        <div>
          <p>At Vision Scholar, we believe that <strong>AI and technology are not threats to human potential—they're powerful amplifiers of it.</strong> In an era of rapid technological change, success isn't about replacing human skills with AI, but about empowering people to work alongside technology to achieve what neither could accomplish alone.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Founded by Fadia Rostom, Vision Scholar was born from a simple observation: organizations that thrive in the age of AI aren't the ones with the most technology—they're the ones whose people know how to harness it effectively.</p>

          <h3 style="color: #3498db; margin-top: 2rem;">Our Approach</h3>
          <p>We bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and real-world application. Through hands-on workshops, strategic planning, and ongoing support, we help individuals and teams move from AI-curious to AI-confident. Our programs don't just teach tools—they transform mindsets, build capabilities, and create cultures where innovation flourishes.</p>

          <h3 style="color: #3498db; margin-top: 2rem;">Leadership Rooted in Experience</h3>
          <p>With 30+ years in education and organizational leadership, Fadia unites technical expertise with a compassionate, human-centered approach to AI integration[web:1]. Backed by degrees in Computer Science and Information Technology plus a license in educational leadership, she turns complex technology into practical tools for growth[web:1].</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As an immigrant who has navigated multiple cultural and professional transitions, Fadia brings authentic understanding and warmth to every collaboration, shaping Vision Scholar’s commitment to accessible, sustainable change[web:1].</p>

          <h3 style="color: #3498db; margin-top: 2rem;">Our Commitment</h3>
          <p>We're not here to sell you on AI hype. We're here to help you discover how AI can genuinely enhance your work, strengthen your teams, and align with your values. Every partnership begins with your goals and ends with measurable results that matter to your organization.</p>

The key edits were made in the "About Vision Scholar" section, specifically under "Leadership Rooted in Experience," to reflect your preferred homepage-ready bio content. All other code and styling remain intact and unchanged.
